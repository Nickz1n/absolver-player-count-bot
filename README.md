# Absolver Player Count BOT
This bot shows at its status how many players are online on [Absolver server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/473690/Absolver)

It is a simple bot but really useful specially because there aren't many people playing this game (unfortunately) and this helps me and my friends decide if we should play or not

## Invite it to your server
Feel free to [invite this bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=879857621643952208&permissions=0&scope=bot) to your server or just add the feature to your bot

## Running it yourself
To run a bot for you with this you need to have a Discord bot token

Assuming you already have a token to run this bot, you should [download the source](https://github.com/pedrokpp/absolver-player-count-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and create a ``token.txt`` file then add the token to the file, then install de requirements of this project using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

_(note that you can and should do this with a virutal-env)_
